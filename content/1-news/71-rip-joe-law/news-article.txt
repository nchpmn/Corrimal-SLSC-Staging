Joe Law joined Corrimal SLSC in 1949 as an Active Senior Member and obtained his Bronze Medallion in the same season. He then obtained his Instructor’s Certificate in 1966/67.

Joe achieved 100% Patrol Attendance Award in ’49/50, ’53/54, ’55/56, ’65/66 and ’66/67.

His positions on the Club Committee included:

- Assistant Secretary ’66/67 – ’69/70
- Club Marshall – ’67/68
- Ambulance Officer ’70/71

He obtained Active Reserve Status in ’70/71.

Joe’s passion in the surf club was surf boat rowing, in which he competed for many years and he was part of a winning crew in many events, most notably the Australian Queen’s Royal Carnival at Bondi Beach on February 6, 1954 – one of Corrimal’s greatest achievements. Have a look at the club’s 100th Anniversary video for a reminder of how big that carnival was.

Joe was the last surviving rower of that great crew, only survived by the legendary sweep Kevin “Cocko” Coleman.

Joe is also listed in the Club’s War Honour Roll, recorded in the 100 Year Book as serving with the AIF (Occupation Forces in Japan).

Joe Law was an outstanding member of Corrimal SLSC for 22 years – Rest In Peace Joe.
