Text: 

For anyone that hasnâ€™t done their proficiency yet, there will be one final test on Boxing Day at 10:00am for all awards.

If you compete or just do patrols, you need to be proficient, not just for Bronze, but ARTC & IRB Crew & Driver.

This includes Active Reserves, Long Service & Life Members
