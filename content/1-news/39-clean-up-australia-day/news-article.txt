2015 Clean Up Australia Day is on! Give us a hand for a couple of hours to clean up our own backyard. Many hands make light work & there’s plenty of plastic & other rubbish to pick up!!

Register at the bike track crossing on Lake Parade or at the end of the Cassel Ave cul-de-sac.

Bring some gloves & a sturdy pair of shoes.

Last year we had about a dozen people turn up from the Surf Club, it would be great to at least double that number. It’s a big area & there’s plenty of rubbish to pick up.

Sunday 1 March 2015
9am-11am

There is an Event page on Facebook if you’re on FB: <https://www.facebook.com/events/382506215252887>
