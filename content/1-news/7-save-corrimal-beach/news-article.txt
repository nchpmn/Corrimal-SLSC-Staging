Title: Save Corrimal Beach

----

Text: 

The introduced, non-indigenous Coastal Wattle is robbing the Corrimal community & many others of a beautiful beach. Coupled with recent bad weather & big seas, it has significantly affected our beach to the extent that in our main swimming / patrolling areas at high tide, we have no beach!!

The 2.1 metre high sand cliffs created by the overgrown Coastal Wattle coupled with recent large surf along the frontal dune presents a significant safety risk, particularly to children who may be digging into or playing around the sand cliff edge.
