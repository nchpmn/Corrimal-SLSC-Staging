Title: SLSA Leaders Masterclass 2015

----

Text: 

The aim of the SLSA Leaders Masterclass is to provide an opportunity for existing leaders within SLSA (at all levels) to participate in a high-level leadership development program. The target audience for this masterclass includes committee members i.e. President, Deputy President, Lifesaving, Surf Sports and Junior/Youth roles. They should either be, aspire to be, or have been identified as being club/branch/state/national leaders into the future (next three years). The masterclass will provide participants with an environment that will enable them to refresh and extend their leadership capabilities.

The program will be informed by best practice in the leadership area and tailored to needs and issues as identified by the participants. It will emphasise a workshop approach providing the opportunity for participants to be proactive in sharing skills and expertise. The program will assist participants in identifying the challenges of leading a Club in the 21st century and the societal issue that will impact on Surf Life Saving at the Club, State and National levels.

Applications close to Branch on the 19 June and to State on 3 July.
