Wollongong City Council are giving our surf club building a birthday!

They are:

1. Replacing the roof sheeting, fascia, eave linings, gutters & down-pipes
1. Removing existing paintwork, re-rendering & repainting
1. Patching any exposed concrete reinforcing
1. Replacing lintels over all doorways & windows
1. Installing a concrete mowing strip around the entire building
1. Installing cladding & flashing to gym to waterproof this part of the building
1. Installing a new stainless steel door jamb & doors on the front door

Works are due to start shortly after Anzac Day 2015 & will take around 4-5 months. Access to sections of the club will be restricted during the project.
