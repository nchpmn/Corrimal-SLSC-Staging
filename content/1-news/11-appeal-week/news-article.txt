Title: Appeal Week

----

Text: 

Appeal week is here again for another year, from the 27th October till 4th November.

This is 1 week every year when we are permitted to door knock and hit up the clubs and pubs in our area for donations.

For the next 2-3 weeks I will be at the surf club for Nippers on Sundays from 10:30am till 12:30pm. If I’m at work, Gail Erven will be their from 11:00am till 12:00 noon (please, if you can’t make any of these times, call me – NO EXCUSES), come down and grab your maps, receipt books and buckets.

It is expected that every senior member takes and completes one area. All Junior families – it is also expected that you take and complete an area as well.

When you do your door knocking please wear patrol uniform or t-shirt – something that shows that you are a member of Corrimal SLSC.

Seniors, please make sure all monies are returned to Louise Chapman ASAP and Juniors, please make sure all monies are returned to Corrinne St George or Tara Robertson ASAP. These people will be provided with the list of names and areas taken so they can be marked off.

This can be a huge money earner for the club, so please – it will only take an hour or so.

We are also looking for volunteers to help out with Corrimal Bowling Club, Corrimal Leagues Club, Palm Court Hotel and Corrimal RSL, these can only be done on Friday 31st October.

Thank you all soooooo much in advance for your time, help and efforts.

TARA
