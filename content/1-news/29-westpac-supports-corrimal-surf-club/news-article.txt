Title: Westpac Supports Corrimal Surf Club

----

Text: 

Westpac Group is now an official supporter of Corrimal Surf Club. For each member or supporter of our Club that takes out a new loan for a home (including transferring your existing loan over to Westpac) or an investment property, Westpac will make a percentage payment to our club upon establishment of the loan & for each year that the loan exists at no additional cost to you!!

All that you need to do is nominate Corrimal Surf Life Saving Club as your charity of choice & mention the following code – I8221224 – when you contact Michael Buchanan, Westpac’s Home Finance Manager.

Please promote this amongst your family & friends as the person nominating our Club does not need to be a member or even have direct involvement in the Club!

There is no obligation to sign up with Westpac if their rates or conditions aren’t competitive…..but if they are, it’s a great opportunity & really easy way to raise funds for the Club.

Any questions, feel free to ask!
