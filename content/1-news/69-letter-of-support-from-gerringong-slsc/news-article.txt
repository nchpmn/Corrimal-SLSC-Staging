Title: Letter of Support from Gerringong SLSC

----

Text: 

Both Corrimal and Port Kembla clubs are receiving gratifying support in numbers for their refusal to sign lifesaving agreements requiring them to patrol on Saturdays.

Hereâ€™s an example.

>GERRINGONG SURF & LIFE SAVING CLUB
>PO BOX 50, GERRINGONG NSW 2534
>ABN 6221985575
>
>To whom it may concern,
>
>I am writing in support of the stance currently being undertaken by both the Corrimal and Port Kembla Surf Life Saving Clubs.
>
>As SLSNSW is hopefully aware, Country and Regional surf clubs are finding it harder and harder to field full patrols each season.
>
>Despite this, SLSNSW seems intent on continually drawing out the length of the surf season and burdening the impost on its volunteer members by increasing their commitments in other areas.
>
>Further example of this can be seen in the current battle between Corrimal and Port Kembla SLS Clubs and SLSNSW.
>
>The recent negative publicity that has SLSNSW has garnered in our area as a result of their refusal to effectively negotiate with Corrimal and Port Kembla is having a negative effect on the movement.
>
>In order to gain new members and keep SLS strong, SLSNSW needs to listen to the needs of their members and not let the movement be continually caught in bureaucratic red tape.
>
>All parties want to see the best for the organisation and SLS continue to flourish however Gerringong certainly supports the stance taken by both clubs in this instance.
>
>We sincerely hope both clubs are allowed to continue to undertake their duties to the same high standard they have in the past.
>
>This is a volunteer organisation and all efforts need to be taken to reduce the impost on members without having an effect on the safety of the general public.
>
>It is painfully clear both of these goals can be achieved in this instance.
>
>Yours sincerely,
>
