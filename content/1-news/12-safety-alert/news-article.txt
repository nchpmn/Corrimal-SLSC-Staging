Title: SAFETY ALERT

Text: 

SAFETY ALERT for all members – over the last couple of weeks we have found 2 used syringes near the surf club.

The first syringe was found against the southern wall of the surf club with a cap over the needle.

Last Sunday, one of the Nipper parents stepped on a syringe whilst walking along the walkway nearest the creek & the needle pierced the person’s foot.

This is an ever-present problem in all public places & one that we all need to be aware of.

The protocol for dealing with a needle-stick injury is:

1. Wash the area with warm soapy water
1. Report the incident to the Patrol Captain or a Club Official – the incident will be recorded in the Incident Log Book
1. Go to your local doctor or hospital for assessment & treatment
1. Dispose of the needle in a “Sharps Container” – there is one in the First Aid Room
