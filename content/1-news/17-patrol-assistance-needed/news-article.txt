Title: Patrol Assistance Needed

----

Text: 

Weâ€™re in desperate need of some people that are not involved in competition or officiating to assist with patrols at our carnival this Saturday.

Please let me (Tony Cartwright) or Jordan Scott know if you can help out. We need people from 7:30am to approximately 3:30pm. If you can only help for a couple of hours, that would do!
