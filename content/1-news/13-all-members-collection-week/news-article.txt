Title: All Members - Collection Week

----

Text: 

This is a reminder to all Corrimal SLSC members. Collection Week 27/10/2014 till 2/11/2014 is the one week of the year we are permitted to knock on doors and ask neighbours and community members for donations. These donations go straight back to our club.

I have several areas/maps still available. We need all of our members to help – please, if you could spare just 1 hour of your time it would be greatly apreciated.

We will also be collecting at Corrimal RSL, Corrimal Pub, Corrimal Bowling Club and Corrimal Leagues Club, so if you would like to come along and give us a hand again it would be greatly apreciated. Make sure you wear your patrol uniform, a hat or t-shirt so we let people know where we come from and how proud we are of our club.

Gail Erven or myself (Tara) will be at Nippers again on Sunday from 11:00am so grab an area/map, bucket and reciept book. If you can’t make it give either Gail or myself a buzz. NO EXCUSES.

Thanks to all in advance.
