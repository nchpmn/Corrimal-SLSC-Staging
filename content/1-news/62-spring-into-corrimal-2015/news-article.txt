Title: Spring into Corrimal

----

Text: 

Calling all Nippers and Surf Club members, We would love you to be part of the Grand parade at Spring into Corrimal this year.

Please let us know if you can come. We will meet at Corrimal Memorial pool at 9.30am. Parade starts at 10am and will finish at the corner of the 7/11 on the princes hwy.

Please reply on Facebook or message Linda Jamieson on 0437 658 225.

It’s always a tough one, because the nippers season hasn’t started when Spring into Corrimal is on, but as many representatives that we can get would be fantastic.

Can’t wait for the season to start, registration dates and other info elsewhere on this website, check it out.
