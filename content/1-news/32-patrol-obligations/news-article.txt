Title: Patrol Obligations

----

Text: 

Ladies & gents – just a general reminder about patrol obligations, particularly as we are coming up to the part of the season where we will be competing on Sundays & major carnivals are just around the corner.

If you’re rostered on & you can’t make it, you need to get a sub. If someone makes a request for a sub & you’re available, please help out.

If you are a proficient patrolling member that does not compete, we would really appreciate if you could put your hand up to cover for some patrols (let Jordan Scott know).

If you’re a Life Member, Long Service Member or Active Reserve, please help out wherever you can.

If you are a non-proficient patrolling member that does not compete, we would really appreciate if you completed your proficiency so that you could volunteer to cover some patrols (let me know about your proficiency & Jordan Scott know about patrols).

If you’re having trouble getting a sub, talk to your Patrol Captain & Jordan (or me if it’s an emergency) to help you sort it out. We have the ability to be flexible – as long as we cover the basic awards – we need a minimum of 3 people on patrol with the following awards covered – Bronze, IRB Driver, IRB Crew (not the same person as the Driver), ARTC & Basic Beach Management.

Patrols are a pain but we have to do them. We can all find excuses why we can’t do them but if we get caught without a patrol on the beach, we’ll be banned from competing at the Branch, State or Aussies – that’s seniors & juniors.

Let’s help each other out!
