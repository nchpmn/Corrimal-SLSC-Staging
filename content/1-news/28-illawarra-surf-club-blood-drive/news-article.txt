Title: Illawarra Surf Club Blood Drive

----

Text: 

Sorry for the month & a bit late notification but we’re in the middle of an Illawarra Branch wide inter-club blood donation competition. I’m pretty sure that everyone knows the importance of donating blood & it’s just another way us Lifesavers can help save a life!

Our efforts & other Illawarra clubs will have a rippling effect throughout the broader Illawarra community, contributing to help save hundreds of lives. One blood donation can save three lives!!

See (file:illawarrasurfclubblooddrive.pdf text:this PDF document) for additional information on donating blood.

We’ve got until 31 March to show the other Illawarra clubs how good we are & it would be great to have our whole club involved. When you visit the Wollongong Blood Donor Centre (45-53 Kembla St Wollongong), just fill out “Club Red” form & any donations that you have made previously will be back-dated. If your friends & family join in, get them to nominate Corrimal as their Club to boost our numbers.

The Blood Donor Centre is open Monday 7am-3pm, Tuesday 12pm-8pm, Wednesday 12pm-8pm, Thursday 10am-4pm, Friday 7am-3pm & Saturday 7am-3pm.

I’m going to go & donate this Friday at 12pm, anyone interested in joining me??
