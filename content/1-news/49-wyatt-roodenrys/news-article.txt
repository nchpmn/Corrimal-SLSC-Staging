Title: Wyatt Roodenrys

Text: 

Today we said goodbye to 4 year old Wyatt Roodenrys.

For his short life, Wyatt was unable to see, walk or talk. Wyatt’s Mum & Dad – Kylie & Matt are ex-surf boat rowers & members of Bulli & Austinmer surf clubs & are friends with many Corrimal Surf Club members.

As a gesture of our sympathy & respect for the Roodenrys, the Committee has decided to donate $100 of surf club funds towards Bear Cottage.

Bear Cottage provides support, respite and end-of-life care for children with life-limiting conditions and their families, in a warm homelike environment.

Wyatt spent heaps of time there & Kylie & Matt recommended the donations go towards them.

Anyone who would like to contribute to the surf club donation is more than welcome – please let Tony Cartwright know if you would like to contribute.

RIP Wyatt
