Title: Trainers, Assessors and Mentors

----

Text: 

A new coaching system is being implemented and expressions of interest are sought by (link: https://www.facebook.com/house.illawarra text: Sls Illawarra) for participants to become Trainers, Assessors and Mentors.

Ideally SLSI would like at least 2 members of each sporting discipline to register their interest to become accredited.

We would like to have the training conducted in the next few weeks and if sufficient numbers register their interest, we may be able to do it locally.

To register your interest, please email Maria as soon as possible at office@slsillawarra.com.au

More details will be provided as soon as we can get an idea of numbers.

on behalf of David Greene
SLSI Director of Surf Sports
