Title: Change of time for Corrimal SLSC AGM

----

Text: 

Due to a change in Corrimal Leagues Club trading hours, the Corrimal Surf Life Saving Club Annual General Meeting will start at 11am (changed from 10am).

You’re coming to the AGM, right?

Yeah. Thought so.

If you haven’t already, make sure you let Tara know.
