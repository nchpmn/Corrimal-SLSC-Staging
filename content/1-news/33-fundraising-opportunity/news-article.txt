Title: Fundraising Opportunity

----

Text: 

Elite Energy is running the Husky Triathlon festival on 20-22 February. They pay $500 per IRB and crew & $100 per board paddler per day.

We have a spare IRB & motor & plenty of spare rescue boards. You’ll need IRB Driver’s or Crew if you’re IRBing.

This will take a bit of organising, so I’ll need to have as much notice as possible if you’re interested.

Could be a good weekend away!
