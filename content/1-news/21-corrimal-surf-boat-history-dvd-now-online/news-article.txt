Title: Corrimal Surf Boat History DVD now Online

----

Text: 

If you haven’t yet seen the DVD produced to celebrate Corrimal Surf Life Saving Club’s involvement with surf boat racing from 1931 to 2004, now you can watch it online right here on this website.

If you’ve never seen surf boat racing at all, this video is a great way to understand its power and majesty and why our boaties get so obsessive about it. Check out the video right now.

This is now a part of our History section, which we want to build up over time to create a permanent online archive of our club’s proud history, a tribute to the many thousands of people who have been involved with Corrimal SLSC over the years.

If you have something you want to contribute, such as a video we can copy, or photos or documents we can scan, we’d be happy to make sure you have your material returned to you safe and sound, and give you appropriate credit on the website. Contact us for more information.
