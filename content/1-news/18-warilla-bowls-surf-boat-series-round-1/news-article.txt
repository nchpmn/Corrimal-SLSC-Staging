Title: Warilla Bowls Surf Boat Series â€“ Round 1

----

Text: 

To all at Corrimal SLSC,

On behalf of the committee, congratulations for a well run carnival. Everything went to plan and no request was a drama. For a Club with the majority of its members competing on the day, it was a tremendous effort. Lots of positive feedback particularly from the Sydney clubs, who are new to the Boat Series.

To the Nipper parents who supplied hungry rowers and others with food a big thank you, job well done.

Again, congratulations on a job well done.

Carole Johnston,
Secretary,
Warilla Bowls Surf Boat Series
