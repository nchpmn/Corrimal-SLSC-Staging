Title: Spring into Corrimal Marshals

----

Text: 

Carty: We’ve had a request from the Corrimal Chamber of Commerce & the Spring into Corrimal Organising Committee seeking help with Spring into Corrimal on Sunday 13 September. They are looking for people to act as crowd marshals during the Grand Parade from 9:30am to 11:30am.

The Chamber are happy to allow us to do a “bucket brigade” amongst the crowd & will donate some additional money in return for our assistance. Please let me know ASAP if you can assist.
