IMPORTANT: If you haven’t do so already, please sign this petition urgently & share with your FB friends. It is important that you sign the petition & not just share the post.

<https://www.change.org/p/the-public-stop-the-close-down-of-port-kembla-slsc>
This petition has been created to help both Corrimal & Port Kembla surf clubs fight the fight that other clubs believe in but weren’t willing to engage in.

Let’s be leaders not sheep! This is an extremely important issue for our club and our actions could trigger actions that will lead to improvements in a movement that we all believe in & want to continue to contribute to!!

If you need help with the petition or you have any questions or concerns, please contact Corrimal SLSC President Tony Cartwright on FB, at tony@knjconsultants.com or on 0433 002 088.
