Title: AGM Wrap Up

----

Text: 

Club President Tony Cartwright: Thank you to the people who attended the Annual General Meeting yesterday. Attached is amended version of the 2014/15 Annual Report & Statement of Accounts with the additional 2 pages from the Statement of Accounts (good pick up Gail & Di).

Not many changes to the Committee this season. I would like to welcome Marti Lancaster as our new Secretary and Shane Thelan as our new Vice Club Captain. Thanks to everyone else who is going to help out again. I’ll post a full list of office bearers in the next couple of days.

For those that couldn’t make AGM, there were some important matters discussed, so please stay tuned for some important announcements in the coming days.

For those of you that are backing up for another season of patrols, please let Jordan know your intentions ASAP.

All members must sign their membership renewal forms and pay their fees – please contact Carole to make arrangements to get this done ASAP.
