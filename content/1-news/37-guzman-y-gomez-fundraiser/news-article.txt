Great news for Corrimal Surf Club – we have a new sponsor – (link: https://www.facebook.com/gygwollongongcentral text: Guzman y Gomez [GYG] – Wollongong Central).

As a start to our relationship, GYG is holding a fundraising day on 7 March for our Club & will be donating $2 for every Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Mini-B & drink purchased.

Please get along to GYG & have Burrito & a nice cold beer or 2 & help us raise some money, better still, get your friends & family in there as well, the more, the merrier.

The fundraiser goes all day – so feel free to pop in at any time!
