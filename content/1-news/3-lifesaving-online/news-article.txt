Text: 

Lifesaving Online is a self-service membership portal for members of clubs and support organisations in Surf Lifesaving. You can renew membership, apply to join a club and check your details, awards and patrol hours from [this site](https://www.lifesavingonline.com.au/SLSA_Online/modules/home/index.php).

NB You can renew your membership via this site but you canâ€™t pay your fees. We are aiming to have on-line payment next season
