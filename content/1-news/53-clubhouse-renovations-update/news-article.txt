----

Carty:

I met with the Project Manager & Builder on Friday 26 June to discuss the impact of the building renovation work on access & use of the surf club:

- All attempts will be made to retain limited access to the building
- The work is scheduled to commence on Monday 6 July & last for approximately 3 months depending on the weather & any unanticipated difficulties associated with removal & replacement of the door & window lintels
- A secure access way will be provided through the scaffold to the front door
- The hall won’t be accessible from the upstairs door on the northern wall
- Access via the IRB & Boat Shed roller doors will be restricted – Todd Johnston we might have to let SLSI know that our IRB & ATV will not be available for emergency response
- Access to the building will be prohibited during periods when the eave linings (contains Asbestos) are being removed
- Access to areas of the building will be restricted when the walls are being water-blasted (paint & render removal)
- Restrictions for access to the gym should be minimal
- The hall will be most affected by access restrictions (Irene Malcolm & Tara Domican) & at this stage, we cannot accurately determine when & how long these restrictions will be in place
- I will keep everyone updated on access restrictions as they arise (with as much notice as possible) following communication with the Builder &/or Project Manager
