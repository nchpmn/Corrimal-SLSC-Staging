Title: Dear Nippers and Families

Text: 

This is to ask if there is anyone that can put their hand up to help us with an age group this year.

At present we don’t have Age Managers for the following age groups: U8, U9, U10 and U12.

It’s not a hard task but it is a commitment. There is an online course that is simple and will help with your understanding of the role, there is also a week to week instruction book of the information your age group needs to know to earn their Surf Awards at the end of the year. The rest of the stuff you already have the experience in … encouraging, supporting kids that are fearful, guiding, communicating, keeping together as a group, marking off names, keeping a record of place getters for point score and club champs and keeping kids sun safe etc.

You are not expected to have all the answers or know everything. I fell into age managing myself and any time I didn’t know something, I approached other age managers and got their support. This year I am happy to be that support for you. If you are a good leader, or good with kids and/or can find another parent to help you, why not give it a go. It’s very rewarding and I’ve learnt so much along the way. There will be others in the same position as you so we can all help each other.

If you can help out please give me a call on 0422 666 056.

Appreciate your time in reading this.

Cheers, Lisa
