Text: 

We need to have a chat about the future of our club – it’s under threat from power-mad administrators of Surf Life Saving!

**12noon-2pm
Saturday 19 September 2015
Corrimal Surf Club
**
If you care about being treated respectfully & fairly as a volunteer & you demand better, get along to this meeting.

Please let other members know what it’s about, when it’s on & encourage them to be here.

You deserve to know the facts of what has happened & we will need to discuss how we will ensure that our proud history continues!!

Life members, senior members, Nipper parents or just interested in helping out – you are all welcome.
