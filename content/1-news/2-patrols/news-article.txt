Title: Patrols

Text: 

It’s nearly that time of year again……Patrols begin on Sunday 21 September.

Jordan Scott is our new Club Captain & is putting the Patrol Roster together at the moment. Stay tuned, there will be some minor changes from last year.

We are also a bit short on IRB Drivers, so we’ll need some people to put up their hands for this award early in the season.
