Title: Wollongong SLSC 100 Year Anniversary Ball

----

Text: 

Wollongong City SLSC is hosting a series of Centenary celebrations during the weekend of 13-15 February 2015.

The pinnacle of the planned celebrations is the Gala Centennial Ball scheduled for Saturday 14 February 2015 at the WIN Entertainment Centre from 5.30pm.

The attached flyer outlines further detail of the event which is planned to be spectacular given the significance of the event we are celebrating. The ticket price covers a three course gourmet meal, 5.5 hour drink package and live entertainment for what will be spectacular celebrations.

In addition to the Ball, we are planning to have informal “reunion” drinks at the Surf Club on the evening of Friday 13 February and a social day on Sunday 15 February.

Given the positive relations enjoyed over 100 years with other Illawarra Clubs, we would certainly enjoy representation of other local Clubs at any/all of the Celebrations over the weekend. I also ask that this information be circulated to your members, some of whom have previously been members of the “Maroon & Whites”.

If you have any questions in relation to our planned Centenary celebrations please ring Mick Jennett on 0414 772 127.
