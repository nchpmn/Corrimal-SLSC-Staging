Corrimal Surf Life Saving Club Inc. endorses the Surf Life Saving Australia Limited (SLSA) policy that states that we are committed to the health, safety and wellbeing of all of our members and are dedicated to providing a safe environment for those participating in surf life saving activities.

Surf lifesavers are nurtured in an environment that values safety, trust, respect, caring and responsibility. This environment encourages acceptance, confidence and risk taking. For surf lifers to venture into challenging waters in times of distress, they need to have faith and trust in themselves and in the people around them.

The motivation for surf lifesavers to give freely of their time is to be found in surf life saving environments that value:

- Safety and support
- Caring and camaraderie
- Trust and teamwork
- Respect and responsibility

As part of the surf lifesaving community, each individual makes a commitment to actively encourage behaviours that promote a supportive and nurturing environment and contribute to our core purpose: “To save lives, create great Australians and build better communities”.
